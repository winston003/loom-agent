    # It does not yet support persistence to disk via 'path'.

    # For now, let's test that it holds data within the session.

    # 1. Run Interaction
    # MockLLM doesn't save to memory, the AgentNode does upon receiving input/output.
    # Target must match the Node's source_uri convention "/node/{id}" -> subject="node/{id}"

    # Since persistence isn't implemented in the viewed code, we skip the 2nd instance check
    # or implement a manual "save/load" simulation if the class supported it.
    # The current code in loom/memory/hierarchical.py definitely does NOT have load logic.
